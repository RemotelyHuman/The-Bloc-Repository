I apologize for the amount of time between my dive updates, but I promise this time it was well worth it.
For the last several months, I've been investigating the "true dive" of floors sub 80-92.
I believe I have found a way to circumvent a large portion of the "true dive".
Now as (I assume) most of you know, floors sub 80-92 are dubbed the "true dive" because it appeared that there was no way through to deeper floors other than by perilous swim, punctuated by occasional air pockets.
However, after some time clearing debris from the pipes, I have found an unflooded tunnel from floors sub 84-92.
As you might assume, this opens the potential for transporting more treasure upwards, or more supplies downwards, as sodden rations rarely last, and drenched treasures sell for much less.
It is rather hard to map due to the layout, however my best attempt to place it on current mappings is attached.
If anyone has any worries about the new passage, Send a dive message, and I will gladly ferry you along.

I met her today, my first time seeing a self made diver. She had never gone sub 60, before.
Claimed she was "as good as the best". I could tell she'd never actually consulted a diver before this point, all the information in her head gleaned from the very surface of /dive/.
I asked her to reconsider, yet she had the gleam of days long gone in her eyes.
She was chasing after her idols, and I could not stop her. The very least I could do was ferry her safely to her destination.
Godspeed, Kara, and may you never experience the true horrors of diving.

Some of the newer divers seem to regard me as some sort of gatekeeper or "master" of the flooded zone. I am neither.
I am but a simple ferryman, and the only blessing I can give is safe passage through my minuscule domain.

I do not regret my decision to give up deep diving.
The horrors of below still have a tight grasp on my mind, and the divers who managed to survive down there might actually scare me more than the things that live there.
Though, with the faces I see constantly changing, it's easy to forget that I was once one of those men, and perhaps, maybe it's myself that scares me the most.

She came back today. Kara, the girl from weeks ago.
Her eyes no longer have the glimmer from when she left, and one of them is gone completely.
She's lost an arm, though I refuse to ask how. She trembles at every rest we take.
I have nothing to say, nothing to grant her, not even kind words of reassurance.
For I know... I know that the depths hold nothing but even worse terrors.
I can only pray she'll safely return to the upper floors.

The days when no divers contract me are the ones where I find myself reflecting on my past the most.
I remember when the Crawler hive of sub 267 spanned maybe a few floors at max.
It was my first time sub 300. That was the only time I ever met {######}.
well, I say "met" but rather I only caught a glimpse him from a distance.
He fought like a beast, tearing through several snatchers before fading into the shadows, disappearing from the rest of the pack, and my own vision.
And like a shadow, he was gone. the only remnant of his presence being the corpses he left behind.
It terrified me, but it was also the first time I felt that burn in my soul. I felt the desire to delve even deeper.
Thankfully my common sense managed to cancel that desire. Self preservation is more important than the dive of course.
However, I will never forget the way my heart began racing, as if I was watching the peak of what men could become.
The peak we could all potentially reach.
