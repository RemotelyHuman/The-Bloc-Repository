﻿>Official /b/loc Thread #1
>OP Note: We are /b/loc. We are returning from an absence. This is not our first thread by far, but this is the first thread that is numbered. We have a discord for the purpose of organizing. h6AvMzb


Maintenance Announcement:

Hello citizens of the /b/loc. The brief Slav uprising has been quashed and prosperity has been restored. The steam plants are operational once again, however some floors are still sub-zero. The Maintenance Community Affairs offices on floor 700 are operational as well.

All dissidence will be met with swift conscription to janitorial. Please report any citizen dissidence to Maintenance immediately. A reward for completing your civic duty may be permitted. All floors with confirmed dissidence will have their vending machines removed.

We would also like to take this time to inform you once again that there is no "sky", "ground floor", "outside", or "sun". Any talk of these harmful concepts will be met with severe punishment or mandatory janitorial service.

/b/loc to prosper,
Maintenance
