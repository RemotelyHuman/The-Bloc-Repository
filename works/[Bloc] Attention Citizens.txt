Attention Citizens,
It has been brought to our attention that there are many of you that have begun rambling and murmuring about a bottom floor, a top floor or even worse, an “outside”.

Maintenance would like to use this opportunity to remind all citizens that any talk of the following is classed as religious propaganda and/or prohibited topics.

“The Outside”
"The Exit"
"The Bottom Floor"
"The Top Floor"
“The Ground Floor"
"Russian Standard Vodka"
"Clean Oxygen"
"Trees".

Anyone found distributing this nonsense or found to be a repeat offender of this disruptive behavior will be conscripted into the janitorial crew.

We recommend that if you are having these thoughts you visit your nearest Maintenance approved medical professional for a checkup and mental evaluation.

Regards,

Maintenance

[Addendum]
