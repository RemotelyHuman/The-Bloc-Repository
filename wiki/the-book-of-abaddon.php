<h1 id="tboa">The Book of Abaddon</h1>
<h2 id="VE">Verse Eins</h2>
<p>The light above holds no sanctuary, no wisdom and no power. Woe to the climber that forever cowers from the truth, for enlightenment will never know him. Woe to the child that stares above in his dreams, for the visions of Abaddon do not reach him. Look not to the lie of above, the sea of untruth that is the sky, but into the Abyss.
Forever descend into the darkness, fear not the beasts and the Devils, for they hunt the bringer of light. Turn your back from those that huddle in fear of what is below and traverse the forbidden waters of the Fringe. Let your journey never cease until the light is forever washed from your mind, let your fall into the embrace of the Empty One continue for eternity, as is the capacity of his wisdom.
Do not bring with you torches and lights, but open your eyes to the truth that is the darkness. Let the Demons caress your dreams in the night, and know that nothing may harm you as you sleep.
</p>
<h2 id="VZ">Verse Zwei</h2>
<ul>
  <li>These are the commandments of Abaddon, whose word is law.</li>
  <li>You are not permitted to seek the “above” or the “outside.”</li>
  <li>You are not permitted to voluntarily sleep in an illuminated area.</li>
  <li>You are not permitted to slay a creature of the Abyss unless threatened by it.</li>
  <li>You are not permitted to slay a Child of Abaddon unless threatened by him.</li>
  <li>You are not permitted to interact with entities believed to come from “above” or “outside.”</li>
  <li>You are not permitted to receive “treatment” for “mental illness.”</li>
  <li>You are not permitted to take a spouse that is not a Child of Abaddon.</li>
  <li>You are not permitted to change or add to the words of Abaddon.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="VD">Verse Drei</h2>
<p> Abaddon will come like a flood, taking everything that is and everything that will be. The waters of the Abyss will consume all levels, and bring with it the fruits of its truth. The creatures of the night will roam all parts of the world, for all parts of the world will become one with the endless Abyss. There will be no light, there will be no surface, there will only be Abaddon, and his Children.
Fear not the Day of Undoing, for it is a joyous occasion. The waters of the Abyss will mend all that is broken, and break all that is mended. Before us will be a new reality, without bounds and without walls.
<br><br>
Amen.
